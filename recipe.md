Sort dried beans and discard any misshapen or discolored beans. Rinse a couple of times, and then soak 1 cup rajma (kidney beans) in enough water to cover them.

Soaking should ideally last for 8 to 9 hours, so I usually soak them the night before I cook.Once the beans are well soaked, discard the soaking water. Drain and rinse the soaked beans a few times to remove any leftover grit, if any.

3. Add the rinsed and drained kidney beans to a 3 litre pressure cooker.

4. Add 3.5 to 4 cups of water and stir. Pressure cook the rajma for 18 to 20 whistles (or for about 15 to 20 minutes).

The cook time of your beans will vary depending on their quality and age.

5. While the kidney beans are cooking, chop 1 large onion (Â¾ to 1 cup finely chopped onion), 2 large tomatoes (1 cup finely chopped tomatoes) and make the crushed ginger+garlic+green chili paste.

For the paste, you need to crush or grind 1 inch ginger, 5 to 6 small garlic cloves (or 3 to 4 medium garlic cloves), and 1 to 2 green chilies to a paste in a mortar-pestle or a small grinder.

finally chopped tomatoes, onion and crushed ginger-garlic-green chillies kept aside for the rajma recipe
6. When the pressure settles down on its own in the cooker, open the lid. Check if the rajma is cooked or not by eating or pressing a bean with your fingers. The cooked beans should not have a bite to them and softened.

The rajma beans should be completely cooked. If they are not cooked completely, then pressure cook again (adding some water if required) for a few more minutes.
